/* JS110 - Lesson 3: Tic Tac Toe walkthough

High-level algorithm:
1. Display the initial empty 3x3 board
2. Ask player to mark a square
3. Let computer mark a square
4. Display the updated board
5. If there's a winning board:
    Display winner
6. If the board is full without a winner:
    Display tie
7. If no winner and no tie:
    Go to #2
8. Ask to play again:
    If yes:
      Go to #1
    If no:
      Say goodbye

Algorithm:
Display the initial empty 3x3 board:
  Create empty board values:
    Set an empty object: board
    Start a loop from 1 to 9 (inclusive):
      Add a key-value pair to the board object:
        Key: String version of the current loop number
        Value: ' ' (one space)
    End looping
    Return the generated (empty) board, and store it to a variable
  Display the board, based on the empty board values

Ask player to mark a square:
  Get a board as input: board
  Set an emty variable to store the player choice: square
  While board doesn't have square as a key OR square is not marked by the player or computer:
    Ask user to pick a square
  End while
  Set square on board to player choice

Let computer mark a square:
  Get the available squares
  Pick a random available square:
    Generate a number between 0 and the number of available squares
  Set the square on the board to the picked square

Display the updated board until there's a winner or a tie:
  Ask player to mark a square
  Let computer mark a square
  Display the board
  Check if someone won:

  Check if the board is full:
    If the are no more available squares:
      The board is full
    Else:
      The board is not full
    End if
